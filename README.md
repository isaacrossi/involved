# Involved
Involved is a site made with D3.js and football API. 
It's purpose is to compare the statistics of the top 20 best performing premier league players during the 21/22 season (in a nice way!)

## Things I learnt:

- How to use d3.js to display data in a beautiful way.
- How to work with an external API.
- How to handle failed HTTP responses from fetch.
- How to work with JSON and get only what is needed from it.
- I also learnt a lot more about svgs, like what elements it can have and how their properties are styled.
